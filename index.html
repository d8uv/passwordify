<h1>Passwordify!</h1>

<p class="tip">Most people, by their own nature, generate shitty
passwords. <b>Passwordify</b> is a tool that makes really strong
passwords for you. Just type in a short master password, the name of
the site you want to make a password for, and you'll get an incredibly
strong password that is almost entirely unbreakable.</p>

<form name="input">
<ul> 

<li>
<label>Master Password: 
  <input type="password" name="in1" placeholder="ff"></label>
<p class="tip">Note, this doesn't need to be very long. Something like
"ff" will provide the same amount of security as
"sIc6yhqqHN0xysPvCgCYnQ==".</p>
</li>

<li>
<label>Name of Site: 
  <input type="text" name="in2" placeholder="d8uv.org">
</label>
</li> 

</ul>
</form>

<h2>And you get:</h2>
