<h1>Passwordify!</h1>

<p>Most people, by their own nature, generate shitty
passwords. <b>Passwordify</b> is a tool that makes really strong
passwords for you. Just type in a short master password, the name of
the site you want to make a password for, and you'll get an incredibly
strong password that is almost entirely unbreakable.</p>

<form name="input">
<ul> 
<li>
<label>Master Password: <input type="text" name="in1"></label>
<p>Note, this doesn't need to be very long. Something like "ff" will
provide the same amount of security as "7Okm2MA1YgUnakUmbTYRYQ==".</p>
</li>
<li><label>Name of Site: <input type="text" name="in2"></label></li> 
</ul>
</form>
